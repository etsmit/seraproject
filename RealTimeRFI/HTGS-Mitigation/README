This document explains how to compile and execute the current codebase.


1) Create directory 'build'
2) In the build directory run 'cmake -DHTGS_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/htgs/src ../'
3) run 'make'
4) Execute with './mitigate'

The input file is specified in main. Currently there are no command-line arguments, so modifying the input file requires recompilation.

You will need to get HTGS from https://github.com/usnistgov/HTGS. It is a header-only library, so just have cmake point to the src directory from the HTGS repo.
