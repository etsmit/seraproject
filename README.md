OFFLINE SK INSTRUCTIONS:

In OfflineRFI/AnalyzeData:


use guppi_SK_fromraw.py to calculate SK on an entire GUPPI raw file (coarse channelized, no accumulations yet) and replace data. The original datafile is preserved.

Supporting functions are found in SK_in_Python.py

Once an SK npy array for a certain accumulation length has been generated by guppi_SK_fromraw.py, you can use it to flag on stricter or looser thresholds using guppi_replace.py. It is simply a stripped down version of the former program that only flags and replaces.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Examples:

Run the entire pipeline on the guppi raw file 'guppi_58626_J1125+7819_0014.0001.raw' in the 'in_dir' directory:


$ python guppi_SK_fromraw.py guppi_58626_J1125+7819_0014.0001.raw J1125+7819_0014_0001_stats False 512 stats 3

The output SK, flags, and spectrogram npy files have the base filename 'J1125+7819_0014_0001_stats'
	and are saved to the 'my_dir' directory.
The raw data in each block is NOT written to npy files that would be saved in 'my_dir'.
SK is run on 512 samples at a time, and Spectrogram is the result from averaging 512 spectra at once
Flagged data is replaced with statistical noise generated by unflagged data in the same channel (or adjacent channels if there is no unflagged data)
3-sigma thresholding for flagging RFI. Corresponds to a probability of false alarm (PFA) of 0.0013499.


For the first two inputs, you may put the full path to directories (start with '/' to trigger this) to avoid the ~hardcoded in_dir and my_dir
