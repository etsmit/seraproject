OFFLINE SK INSTRUCTIONS:

In OfflineRFI/AnalyzeData:


use guppi_SK_fromraw.py to calculate SK on an entire GUPPI raw file (coarse channelized, no accumulations yet) and replace data. The original datafile is preserved.

Supporting functions are found in SK_in_Python.py

Once an SK npy array for a certain accumulation length has been generated by guppi_SK_fromraw.py, you can use it to flag on stricter or looser thresholds using guppi_replace.py. It is simply a stripped down version of the former program that only flags and replaces.
